# Challenge 2
This problem is very short, but it took a long time of googling and reading math wikis to fully understand what exactly I was creating.
In this challenge we create a function of Numerical Differentiation. This function is a way to solve a numerical approximation of a derivative. The math took me a while to understand, but it's a cool concept and I suggest you try googling it as well!

My main take-away with this challenge was passing a function as a parameter, specifically one with it's own parameter. It was a cool mental exercise and this was a great way to show why passing parameters can be useful.
